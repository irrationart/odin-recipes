        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Pour the milk into a bowl. Sift in the flour, corn starch (or custard powder), and icing sugar. With a balloon whisk, mix the ingredients until they are combined well.</li>
            <li>Add and mix the melted butter and lightly beaten eggs.</li>
            <li>Pour the mixture via a sieve into a measuring cup or another bowl.</li>
            <li>Heat a pan over low heat.</li>
            <li>After pouring a small bit of batter onto the pan, swirl it quickly to form a thin disk.</li>
            <li>Transfer the pancake from the pan to a plate to cool when small air pockets appear under it. There is no need to cook the other side.</li>
            <li>Repeat Steps 4 to 6 until the batter is all used up.</li>
            <li>Whip the cream with vanilla extract and icing sugar. Stop when stiff peaks form.</li>
            <li>Lay a pancake with its smooth and clear side facing down on a flat surface.</li>
            <li>Before placing a piece of mango on top, spoon whipped cream onto the middle of the pancake.</li>
            <li>Fold the pancake from four sides into a shape resembling a pillow.</li>
            <li>Serve with the folded-side down. It is recommended to serve after refrigerating for approximately 30 minutes.</li>
        </ol>
