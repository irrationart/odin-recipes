        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p><strong>The recipe below should not be used as an actual recipe.</strong></p>
        <p>The full recipe referenced (and heavily paraphrased) in this webpage can be found at: <em><a href="https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/223234/macaron-french-macaroon/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/223234/macaron-french-macaroon/</a></em>.</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Egg Whites (3)</li>
            <li>White Sugar (1/4 cup)</li>
            <li>Confectioners' Sugar (1 and 2/3 cups)</li>
            <li>Finely ground Almonds (1 cup)</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>With a silicone baking mat, line a baking sheet.</li>
            <li>Beat egg whites until foamy. After, add white sugar and continue beating egg whites until they are fluffy, glossy, and hold soft peaks.</li>
            <li>Sift ground almonds and confectioners' sugar in a different bowl, then swiftly fold the mixture into the egg whites (roughly 30 strokes).</li>
            <li>Spoon a little bit of batter into a plastic bag and cut a small corner off. Test the batter by piping a disk (about 3.8 cm) onto the baking sheet. If the disk does not flatten immediately and instead holds a peak, fold the batter a little more and retry.</li>
            <li>Once the batter is able to flatten immediately into a disk, spoon it into a pastry bag with a plain round tip. Leaving space in between disks, pipe the batter onto the baking sheet. Let the disks remain at room temperature until their tops harden (approximately 1 hour).</li>
            <li>Preheat oven to 140 degrees Celsius.</li>
            <li>Bake disks in oven until set, though not browned (approximately 10 minutes).</li>
            <li>Cool disks fully before filling (about half an hour).</li>
        </ol>
